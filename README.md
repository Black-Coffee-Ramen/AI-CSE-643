## Project 1: Classical Search & Game Tree Reasoning
**Keywords:** A*, UCS, IDS, Bidirectional Search, Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning  
**Skills:** Python, Heuristics, Graph Theory, Game Tree Modeling

### Overview:
Implemented classical uninformed and informed search algorithms to find optimal paths across IIIT Delhi’s campus graph. Extended the work to adversarial reasoning using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning with best/worst-case optimization.

### Highlights:
- Compared A*, UCS, IDS, and Bidirectional A* on real map data.
- Benchmarked path cost, memory, and runtime.
- Visualized search behavior and node expansions.
- Demonstrated complexity optimization in game trees using Alpha-Beta Pruning.

## Project 2: Knowledge Representation & Reasoning
**Keywords:** FOL, PL, Resolution Refutation, PyDatalog, PDDL  
**Skills:** Logic Programming, Rule-based Systems, Symbolic Reasoning, Planning

### Overview:
Designed real-world logical systems using First-Order Logic (FOL) and implemented symbolic reasoning over transit networks. Developed planners for routing and fare-constrained travel using PyDatalog and PDDL.

### Highlights:
- Encoded traffic light systems and graph colorings using FOL.
- Solved dolphin literacy paradox using resolution refutation.
- Developed planners using Forward and Backward Chaining.
- Modeled constrained routing using PDDL and logical rules.

## Project 3: Bayesian Networks & Hidden Markov Models
**Keywords:** Gibbs Sampling, Bayesian Inference, CPT Pruning, Viterbi  
**Skills:** Probabilistic Modeling, bnlearn, HMMs, Gaussian Noise Simulation

### Overview:
Built a fare classification model using Bayesian Networks and optimized it via pruning and structure learning. Implemented a Viterbi-based tracker for a robotic vacuum cleaner (Roomba) using noisy sensor data modeled as an HMM.

### Highlights:
- Developed 3 versions of a Bayesian Network for fare prediction.
- Modeled adversarial ML scenarios using Bayesian belief updates.
- Built and visualized an HMM to track Roomba's path.
- Achieved high accuracy across multiple seeds and noise levels.

**Keywords:** Decision Tree, Hyperparameter Tuning, SMOTE, ADASYN, Random Forest  
**Skills:** Scikit-learn, EDA, Pruning, Cross-Validation, Ensemble Models

### Overview:
Designed a decision tree regressor to predict property prices. Focused on feature engineering, imbalance handling, pruning, and evaluation using real-world housing data.

### Highlights:
- Achieved R² ≈ 0.993 on both train and test sets.
